        <h1 style="color: black;">My name is Mikhael, I am a Digital illustration designer</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
            I am 26 years old, and I am from Georgia.
            Currently, I live in Italy, but my creativity started in Georgia, 
            specifically in Tbilisi.  During the student period.  I studied at 
            the Faculty of Visual Design at the Ilia Chavchavadze University of Georgia.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
            In my free time, I always listened to music, made sketches, and combined various 
            drawings or ready-made objects, and then something interesting was created.  
            But every time something was missing, it's like putting together a puzzle and in 
            the process of completing it, you lose the central part of the puzzle.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
            In 2019, I started studying photography, music, and digital art simultaneously at the university. 
            I wanted to learn a lot more about modern art!!! I could go into the depth of what is called 
            details and find my style, and also the direction I needed.  And every time I felt dissatisfied, 
            I wanted to have something valuable and at the same time different from everyone else, and in 2020 I made this wish a reality.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
            My style is distinguished by radically different actions and directions. 
            I create different illustrations only through the phone.
            With this, I emphasize the possibilities and presentation of my style.

        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
          I began my programming career at the age of 16, I was fascinated by coding while translating flowcharts programs into Python code.
          A little over a year ago I stumbled upon Blockchain technology, starting from Ethereum and then studying also other architectures.
          In my spare time I enjoy writing both technical and reflective articles on tech related topics.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
            Now I am a Digital illustration designer
            And I make Interior illustrations from various materials, 
            and I offer them to the community who like art and illustrated views.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: left; color: black;">
            For me, art in a broad sense is an expression of human imagination and representation.  
            Something different and not pre-exaggerated action.  which combines reality and various forms of imagination.
